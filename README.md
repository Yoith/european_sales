# European Sales Project

---

## Overview

The European Sales project involves conducting a series of SQL queries on a database obtained from Kaggle. The database comprises records of European sales spanning from 2010 to 2017. It includes information about countries, types of products, sales channels (both online and offline), priority type of products, order date, and product shipping date. Additionally, it provides data on the number of units sold, cost per unit, as well as the profit, cost, and final benefit.

After executing the queries, a presentation is crafted using Tableau to visualize the relationships within the data. The Tableau presentation consists of a story with 3 distinct interactive dashboards. Each dashboard is equipped with 5 filters: by countries, by priority type, by order date, by product type, and by sales channel.
